## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Sharing Your Screen (Host)
1. Launch the application
2. Go to **"Host (Server)"** tab
3. Click **"Start Server"** - generates a secure session code
4. Share the 6-digit code with the person who needs to connect
5. **(Optional)** Click **"Enable Stealth Mode"** for complete invisibility

### For Connecting to Someone (Client)
1. Go to **"Connect (Client)"** tab
2. Enter the 6-digit session code
3. Click **"Connect to Session"**
4. You'll see their screen and can control it remotely

### 🥷 Stealth Mode Usage

**To Hide Completely:**
- Click the **"Enable Stealth Mode"** button
- Application becomes invisible to:
  - Task Manager
  - Taskbar
  - Alt+Tab menu
  - Most security software
  - Proctoring applications

**To Unhide:**
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U** (global hotkey)
- Or use the system tray icon (appears as "Windows Update Helper")

## 🛡️ Security Software Compatibility

### ✅ Successfully Bypasses:
- **Respondus Lockdown Browser** - Advanced detection evasion
- **Safe Exam Browser (SEB)** - Multiple bypass techniques
- **Standard Corporate Monitoring** - Process hiding and obfuscation
- **Browser-Based Proctoring** - Network traffic masking
- **Basic System Monitoring** - Behavioral pattern masking

### ⚠️ Limitations:
- **Advanced Kernel-Level Monitoring**: Some enterprise solutions may detect
- **Physical Hardware Monitoring**: Hardware-based detection is harder to bypass
- **Deep Packet Inspection**: Advanced network analysis may identify patterns

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Client-Server Model
```
[Host Computer] ←→ [Relay Server] ←→ [Client Computer]
     |                   |                    |
Screen Capture      WebSocket Proxy    Remote Viewing
Input Handling      Session Management  Input Control
Encryption          Load Balancing      Decryption
```

### Encryption Flow
1. **Key Generation**: 256-bit AES keys generated per session
2. **Secure Exchange**: Keys exchanged via encrypted channels
3. **Data Encryption**: All screen/input data encrypted end-to-end
4. **Session Isolation**: Each session uses unique encryption keys

### Command Line Options
```bash
# Run with debug logging
python main.py --debug

# Run in stealth mode from start
python main.py --stealth

# Use custom relay server
python main.py --relay wss://your-server.com
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set custom relay server
set IGNITE_RELAY_SERVER=wss://your-server.com

# Enable debug mode
set IGNITE_DEBUG=1

# Force stealth mode
set IGNITE_STEALTH=1
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **"Connection failed"**: Check internet connection and firewall
- **"Session not found"**: Verify the 6-digit code is correct
- **"Relay server error"**: Server may be under maintenance

### Performance Issues
- **Slow screen updates**: Close unnecessary applications
- **High CPU usage**: Lower the frame rate in settings
- **Network lag**: Check bandwidth and network stability

### Stealth Mode Issues
- **Still visible in Task Manager**: Run as administrator for advanced hiding
- **Hotkey not working**: Check if another app is using the same combination
- **Detected by security software**: Update to latest version for new bypass techniques
